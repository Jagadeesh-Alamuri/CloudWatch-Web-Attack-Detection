# Autonomous Malicious Traffic Detection System

![Traffic Analysis](images/traffic_distribution.png)

## 📌 Project Overview
An orchestrated autonomous system designed to analyze server logs and identify security threats in real-time. By processing over **100,000 log entries daily**, this system differentiates between normative user behavior and potential web intrusions with high precision.

## 🚀 Key Achievements
* **92% Precision:** Achieved through a hybrid model combining Isolation Forest and 1D-CNN.
* **40% Reduction in False Positives:** Engineered a real-time monitoring solution to improve alert accuracy.
* **35% Faster Incident Response:** Optimized data pipelines for automated log processing and scoring.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The ecosystem utilizes a dual-layer detection strategy:
1. **Unsupervised Outlier Recognition:** Leveraging **Isolation Forest** to identify anomalous spikes and patterns without labeled data.
2. **Deep Feature Extraction:** Implementing a **1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN)** to analyze sequential patterns in web traffic.

## 📊 Data Visualization & Insights
